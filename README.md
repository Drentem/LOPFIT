# Lots of Phrases Fit In This
## Todo list:
#### Backend (Phrase Expansion)
* Thread out the listener from the GUI (threading module is built into python)
* Give a way to stop the listener thread when the webpage is opened or somehow stop listening when we are on the page directly
#### Frontend (GUI)
* Add buttons for add/remove folders and phrases
* Generate API to call in phrases from the database to the GUI
* Add JS to handle API calls and frontend updates (Folders, Phrases)
