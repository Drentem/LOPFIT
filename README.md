# Lots of Phrases Fit In This
## Todo list:
#### Backend (Phrase Expansion)
- [ ] Thread out the listener from the GUI (threading module is built into python)
  - [ ] Need listener to identify what program/tab it was in. If new, reset check.
    - [ ] Need listener to identify if it is in the LOPFIT tab. If so, disable until out of tab.
    - [ ] Listener needs to detect and ignore password boxes
    - [ ] Listener needs to detect when moving from one box to another (Selenium?)

#### Frontend (GUI)
### COMPLETE!!!
- [x] Add selector for end key (Testing complete)
- [x] Generate API to call in phrases from the database to the GUI (Testing complete)
